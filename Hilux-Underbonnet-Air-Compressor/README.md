# Hilux Underbonnet Air Compressor

- Work-in-progress
- Project to create a bracket to mount an air compressor within car engine bay

### iPhone

- Utilizing iPhone FaceID (similar to LiDAR) to map engine bay geometry
- iPhone app used: Capture by Standard Cyborg
- Several individual sections of bonnet scanned individually (limitation of FaceID and Capture software)

### MeshLab

- Multiple point clouds aligned automatically with manual correction
- Point cloud converted to meshes for use in Solidworks
- Export overall and cutdown meshes

### Solidworks

- An overall surface with all surrounding components used to check clearance with engine components
- A cutdown surface includes just the geometry needed to build reference planes and holes from which to construct the bracket
- Build bracket up section by section

### TODO

- Complete bracket model
- Prototyping
- Run topology study to minimise mass
- Manually cut material from model
- Create drawing
- Send to manufacture
